# Obstacle Tower Challenge RL
Trained an agent to compete in the ![Obstacle tower challenge](www.aicrowd.com/challenges/unity-obstacle-tower-challenge)  
For this, we used a Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) to train a reinforcement learning agent to play the Obstacle Tower challenge game. The agent was trained over ~5 million steps and learned how to navigate the environment to a degree, successfully navigating the first few levels.

To Do:  
Add more moves to the action space  
Include more wrappers to exponentially improve learning (must train for longer)
